# Discord-Chat-Monitor

As far as i'm concerned, discord should not be trusted as far as security(pfs) goes. 

I wouldn't put anything on discord that I wouldn't put on the back of a post-it note.

Sole purpose of logging all chat messages(server), uploads and private chats on the user.

Not perfect; you'll need a token in order to log.

Sidenote: To log bots; remove bot=False ( useful as just saying ;))

[+] Use another client [+]

[+] Other points [+]

### 1.) clear text chats can be stored. ["Once a message or image has been deleted, it is gone from our servers and we are unable to verify it to take action."](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/aukk3p/psa_deleted_messages_are_instantly_deleted_from/) also see [this](https://dotesports.com/culture/news/report-fbi-investigating-discord-for-rise-in-cyber-crime) " but we can't do anything if they're deleted, sorry fbi ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"


### 2.) Discord's cache is a useful in saving bandwidth but it also can be abused, very effective if retrieving images from users if it were to be used for malicious intent.

### 3.) Discord's Privacy/Data Retention Policy.





not implicitly aimed at discord. all clients suck - it just so happens that this one sucks more.
